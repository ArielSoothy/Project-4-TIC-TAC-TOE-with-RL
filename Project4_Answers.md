# Project 4: TIC-TAC-TOE with RL - Answers

## 1. Monte Carlo Method: Tuning Hyperparameters and Analyzing Impact on Game Performance

### 1.a Set Initial Parameters ✅ COMPLETED
We successfully set the initial parameters as required:
- size = 3 (3x3 board)
- learning_rate = 0.001
- discount_factor = 0.99
- epsilon = 0.1 (exploration rate)
- episodes = 100,000 (number of training episodes)

The Monte Carlo agent was trained with these parameters and successfully learned to play Tic Tac Toe.

### 1.b Modify and Test Each Parameter ❌ TODO
**MISSING:** Need to systematically test different parameter values:
- Learning Rate variations (higher/lower values)
- Discount Factor experiments (closer to 1 and 0)
- Epsilon variations (different exploration rates)
- Episodes adjustments (different training amounts)

### 1.c Plot Game Statistics ❌ TODO
**MISSING:** Need to create comparative plots showing:
- Win rate, loss rate, and draw rate before and after parameter adjustments
- Choose 2 specific parameter modifications and visualize their impact
- Statistical analysis of performance changes

## 2. Implementing and Tuning Q-Learning for Tic Tac Toe

### 2.a Complete the "update_q_table" function ✅ COMPLETED
Successfully implemented the Q-learning update rule using the Bellman equation:
```python
max_next_q_value = max(q_table[next_state_str].values())
q_table[state_str][action] += learning_rate * (reward + discount_factor * max_next_q_value - q_table[state_str][action])
```

The implementation correctly computes the maximum Q-value for the next state and updates the current state-action pair.

### 2.b-f Parameter Analysis ❌ TODO
**MISSING:** Need to analyze the impact of parameter changes:

- **2.b** Change learning rate to 0.1 and analyze convergence/stability effects
- **2.c** Test discount factors 0.9 and 0.5 and analyze immediate vs future reward prioritization
- **2.d** Modify epsilon to 1 and analyze exploration vs exploitation trade-off
- **2.e** Train with 10,000,000 episodes and analyze learning outcomes
- **2.f** Change tie_reward to negative value and explain the impact

**Current Status:** We implemented Q-learning with different parameters but didn't provide the required comparative analysis.

## 3. Boosting Q-Learning with Deep Learning: Investigating DQN and DDQN

### 3.a Neural Network Integration Analysis ❌ TODO
**MISSING:** Need to explain:
- Where and how neural networks should be integrated in Q-learning
- Advantages and disadvantages of this integration

### 3.b Neural Network Architecture ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETED
**COMPLETED:** We have a DQN agent class structure
**MISSING:** The `_build_model()` function shows "..." instead of complete implementation
**TODO:** Need to complete the neural network architecture specification

### 3.c DQN vs DDQN Comparison ❌ TODO
**MISSING:** Need to provide:
- Analysis of DDQN improvements over DQN
- Comparison of overestimation minimization
- Training stability analysis
- Win rates, loss rates, and tie rates comparison between both algorithms

**Current Status:** We have both DQN and DDQN implementation but no comparative analysis.
