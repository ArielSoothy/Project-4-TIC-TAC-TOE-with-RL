## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this educational experience, learners will understand:

1. **What Reinforcement Learning is** and how it differs from other AI approaches
2. **Three different RL methods:**
   - Monte Carlo: Patient, episode-based learning
   - Q-Learning: Immediate, step-by-step learning  
   - Deep Q-Networks: Neural network-powered learning
3. **The importance of parameter tuning** in AI systems
4. **How to compare AI methods** scientifically
5. **When to use each method** based on the problem requirements
6. **Key RL concepts:** exploration vs exploitation, reward systems, learning rates

## 🎉 Key Discoveries Highlighted

### The Surprising Results
- **30% exploration rate** achieved 94% win rate (vs conventional 10%)
- **More training hurt Q-Learning** - overtraining led to performance degradation
- **Simple methods can outperform complex ones** - Monte Carlo beat neural networks
- **Parameter tuning is crucial** - settings changed win rates from 37% to 94%

### Real-World Applications
- **Monte Carlo**: Optimal for simple, well-defined games and problems
- **Q-Learning**: Best for real-time learning and dynamic environments
- **Deep Q-Networks**: Essential for complex, high-dimensional problems

## 🚀 Getting Started
