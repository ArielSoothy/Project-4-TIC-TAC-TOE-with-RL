# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Experiments - Complete Analysis 

## 🎯 What We Did (High Level)

We trained AI agents to play Tic-Tac-Toe using **two different reinforcement learning methods**:
1. **Monte Carlo** - Learns from complete game results
2. **Q-learning** - Learns step-by-step during the game

Then we tested how different "knobs" (parameters) affect each method's performance.

# 🚀 Part 1: Monte Carlo Method Results

## 🧪 The Experiment Setup

**Think of it like tuning a car engine:**
- We have 4 different "knobs" we can turn
- Each knob changes how the AI learns
- We tested different settings for each knob
- We measured how well the AI plays after training

## 🎛️ The 4 "Knobs" We Tested

### 1. **Learning Rate** (How fast the AI learns)
- **What it does:** Controls how quickly the AI updates its knowledge
- **Like:** How fast you absorb new information when studying
- **Settings tested:** 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5

### 2. **Epsilon** (How much the AI explores vs uses what it knows)
- **What it does:** Controls how often the AI tries random moves vs playing its best move
- **Like:** How often you try new restaurants vs going to your favorite
- **Settings tested:** 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.9

### 3. **Discount Factor** (How much the AI cares about future vs immediate rewards)
- **What it does:** Controls whether the AI thinks ahead or focuses on immediate gains
- **Like:** Saving for retirement vs spending money now
- **Settings tested:** 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99

### 4. **Episodes** (How long we train the AI)
- **What it does:** How many practice games the AI plays before we test it
- **Like:** How many hours you study before taking a test
- **Settings tested:** 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000 games

## 📊 Monte Carlo Results

### 🥇 **THE WINNERS:**

| Parameter | Best Setting | Win Rate | Surprise Level |
|-----------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **Learning Rate** | 0.001 | 84% | None - Expected |
| **Epsilon** | 0.3 | **94%** | 🤯 **HUGE SURPRISE!** |
| **Discount Factor** | 0.99 | 92% | Expected |
| **Episodes** | 20,000 | 78% | Expected |

### 🤔 **What Each Result Means:**

**Learning Rate (84% win rate):**
- Sweet spot: Not too fast, not too slow
- Like studying at a steady pace - you retain information better

**Epsilon - THE BIG SURPRISE (94% win rate):**
- Higher exploration (30% random moves) worked BETTER than expected
- **Why this is shocking:** Usually we want less randomness, not more!
- **What it means:** Tic-Tac-Toe benefits from trying diverse strategies

**Discount Factor (92% win rate):**
- Thinking ahead pays off in Tic-Tac-Toe
- Like a chess player - planning several moves ahead wins games

**Episodes (78% win rate):**
- More practice = better performance (as expected)
- But gains slow down after 10,000 games

# ⚡ Part 2: Q-Learning Method Results

## 🧪 Q-Learning vs Monte Carlo

**Q-learning is like having a GPS that recalculates after each turn:**
- Monte Carlo waits until the end of the trip to learn
- Q-learning learns from each step along the way
- This makes Q-learning potentially faster but more complex

## 🎯 What We Tested for Q-Learning

We ran the same types of experiments but with some specific Q-learning questions:

### **Test 2.b: Learning Rate = 0.1**
- **Result:** 62.0% win, 21.9% loss, 16.1% tie
- **What it means:** Faster learning but less stable than Monte Carlo
- **Like:** Cramming for a test - you learn quickly but forget easier

### **Test 2.c: Discount Factors (0.9 vs 0.5)**  
- **Discount Factor 0.9:** 40.6% win, 35.2% loss, 24.1% tie
- **Discount Factor 0.5:** 41.6% win, 34.3% loss, 24.1% tie
- **What it means:** Q-learning struggles more with short-term thinking
- **Like:** Being impatient hurts your game strategy even more in Q-learning

### **Test 2.d: Pure Exploration (Epsilon = 1)**
- **Result:** 43.8% win, 34.4% loss, 21.9% tie  
- **What it means:** Playing randomly destroys Q-learning performance
- **Like:** Making completely random decisions - you learn nothing useful

### **Test 2.e: Extended Training (50,000 games)**
- **Result:** 37.2% win, 36.9% loss, 25.9% tie
- **What it means:** 🚨 **SURPRISE!** More training actually hurt performance
- **Like:** Over-studying and burning out - sometimes more isn't better

### **Test 2.f: Negative Tie Punishment (-1 reward)**
- **Result:** 44.2% win, 37.4% loss, 18.5% tie
- **What it means:** AI learned to avoid ties but took more risks
- **Like:** Avoiding "boring" outcomes but sometimes making reckless moves

## 📊 Q-Learning vs Monte Carlo Comparison

| Method | Best Win Rate | Key Strength | Key Weakness |
|--------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Monte Carlo** | **94%** | Stable, finds great strategies | Slower learning |
| **Q-Learning** | **62%** | Learns step-by-step | More sensitive to parameters |

## 🤔 Big Insights from Q-Learning

# 🧠 Part 3: Deep Q-Network (DQN) Results

## 🤖 DQN vs Traditional Methods

**DQN is like having a smart brain that learns patterns:**
- Monte Carlo waits until the end of the trip to learn
- Q-learning learns from each step along the way  
- **DQN uses a "neural brain" that recognizes patterns** instead of memorizing every situation

## 🎯 What We Tested for DQN

### **DQN Training Configuration:**
- **Training Time:** 21 minutes for 100 episodes (much longer than others!)
- **Architecture:** Neural network with 64→32→16 hidden layers
- **State Input:** Board represented as 9 numbers (0=empty, 1=X, -1=O)
- **Output:** 9 Q-values (one for each board position)

### **DQN Performance Results:**
- **Gameplay:** Showed strategic behavior in test games
- **Learning:** Successfully learned to play within 100 episodes
- **Strategy:** Demonstrated winning moves against random opponents
- **Scalability:** Can handle much larger games than Tic-Tac-Toe

## 🧠 Neural Network vs Q-Table

### **Traditional Q-Learning (Dictionary):**
```
Q-table = {
  'board_state_1': {move1: 0.8, move2: 0.3, move3: 0.9},
  'board_state_2': {move1: 0.1, move2: 0.7, move3: 0.4}
}
```
- Like having a huge filing cabinet with every situation memorized
- Fast lookup but needs to see every situation first

### **DQN (Neural Network):**
```
Neural Network Input: [0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0]
Neural Network Output: [0.8, 0.3, 0.9, 0.1, 0.7, 0.4, 0.2, 0.6, 0.5]
```
- Like having a smart brain that recognizes patterns
- Can guess good moves even in new situations it's never seen

## 📊 Three-Way Method Comparison

| Method | Best Performance | Training Time | Memory | Best For |
