# 🎯 Reinforcement Learning Project: Teaching AI to Master Tic-Tac-Toe

**Part of Google-Reichman AI & Deep Learning Course | Project 4**

## 🚀 Project Overview

I implemented and compared four different reinforcement learning algorithms to solve Tic-Tac-Toe, creating an interactive educational website that makes AI concepts accessible to everyone.

## 🧠 AI Methods Implemented & Results

### 🏆 Champion: Monte Carlo Method - 94% Win Rate
- **Approach:** Episode-based learning with complete game analysis
- **Key Insight:** 30% exploration rate outperformed conventional 10%
- **Best Use Case:** Simple, well-defined problems requiring reliability

### 📊 Q-Learning - 62% Win Rate  
- **Approach:** Immediate step-by-step learning with Bellman equation
- **Surprising Discovery:** More training actually hurt performance (overtraining)
- **Best Use Case:** Real-time learning and dynamic environments

### 🧠 Deep Q-Networks (DQN) - 87% Win Rate
- **Architecture:** 9→64→32→16→9 neural network with ReLU activation
- **Training:** 100 episodes, experience replay, target networks
- **Challenge:** Overestimation bias in Q-value calculations

### 🛡️ Double DQN (DDQN) - 82% Win Rate
- **Innovation:** Decoupled action selection from value evaluation
- **Success:** Reduced overestimation bias with better training stability
- **Trade-off:** Slightly lower peak performance but more consistent

## 🔬 Key Experimental Findings

1. **Parameter Tuning is Critical:** Settings changed win rates from 37% to 94%
2. **Exploration vs Exploitation:** 30% random exploration beat 10% focused strategy
3. **Training Paradox:** Q-Learning performance degraded with excessive training
4. **Bias Reduction Works:** DDQN successfully addressed DQN's overestimation issues
