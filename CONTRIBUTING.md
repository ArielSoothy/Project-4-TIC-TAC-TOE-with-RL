# Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in improving this RL Tic-Tac-Toe project! To keep quality high and the experience smooth, please follow these guidelines.

## Issues
- Search existing issues before opening a new one.
- Provide steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and environment details.

## Pull Requests
- Keep PRs focused and small.
- Describe the problem and the solution clearly.
- Include screenshots/GIFs for UI changes.
- Update docs as needed (`README.md`).

## Code Style
- Keep HTML semantic and accessible (labels, roles, `aria-*`).
- Prefer readable variable names and early returns.
- Avoid inline comments that explain obvious code; write self-explanatory code.

## UI/UX Standards
- Maintain keyboard navigation and contrast ratios.
- Test on mobile (â‰¤768px) and desktop.
- Do not remove accessibility features (skip link, ARIA live regions).

## Project Structure
- Web UI lives in `index.html` (no build step, static).
- Models and notebooks live under `models/` and the provided notebooks.
- Do not commit large artifacts; keep model files under 50MB.
