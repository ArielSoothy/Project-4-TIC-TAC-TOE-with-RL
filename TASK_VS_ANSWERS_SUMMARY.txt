PROJECT 4: TIC-TAC-TOE with RL - TASK vs ANSWERS VERIFICATION

=================================================================
QUESTION 1: MONTE CARLO METHOD
=================================================================

TASK 1.a: Set Initial Parameters
ASKED: "Begin with the following default settings: size = 3, learning_rate = 0.001, discount_factor = 0.99, epsilon = 0.1, episodes = 100,000"
ANSWER: ✅ COMPLETED - Parameters set, agent trained with 10,000 episodes (reduced for local testing)

TASK 1.b: Modify and Test Each Parameter  
ASKED: "Increase and decrease the learning rate. Observe how faster or slower learning rates affect convergence speed and stability"
ANSWER: ✅ COMPLETED - Tested [0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5], found 0.01 optimal (84% win rate)

ASKED: "Experiment with higher and lower values close to 1 and 0, respectively. Assess how this impacts the agent's prioritization of immediate versus future rewards"
ANSWER: ✅ COMPLETED - Tested [0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99], found 0.7-0.95 best (88% win rate)

ASKED: "Vary the epsilon value to alter the balance between exploration and exploitation. Note changes in ability to discover new strategies versus refining known strategies"
ANSWER: ✅ COMPLETED - Tested [0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.9], found 0.3 best (86% win rate)

ASKED: "Adjust the number of episodes. Evaluate how the amount of training impacts the agent's overall performance"
ANSWER: ✅ COMPLETED - Tested [1K, 5K, 10K, 20K], found 20K best (88% win rate)

TASK 1.c: Plot Game Statistics
ASKED: "Choose 2 parameter adjustments, plot the win rate, loss rate, and draw rate before and after adjustment"
ANSWER: ✅ COMPLETED - Chose epsilon (0.1→0.3: 74%→86% win) and discount factor (0.99→0.7: 78%→88% win), created bar charts

=================================================================
QUESTION 2: Q-LEARNING IMPLEMENTATION
=================================================================

TASK 2.a: Complete the "update_q_table" function
ASKED: "Compute the maximum Q-value for the next state, which is a key component in the update rule"
ANSWER: ✅ COMPLETED - Implemented: max_next_q_value = max(q_table[next_state_str].values())

TASK 2.b: Learning Rate Analysis
ASKED: "Changing the learning rate to 0.1. How do changes in the learning rate affect the convergence and stability of the agent's learning?"
ANSWER: ✅ COMPLETED - Result: 62.0% win, 21.9% loss, 16.1% tie. Higher learning rate shows faster convergence but reduced stability.

TASK 2.c: Discount Factor Analysis  
ASKED: "How does adjusting the discount factor to 0.9 and 0.5 influence the agent's prioritization of immediate versus future rewards?"
ANSWER: ✅ COMPLETED - DF=0.9: 40.6% win, DF=0.5: 41.6% win. Lower factors prioritize immediate rewards, leading to short-sighted decisions.

TASK 2.d: Epsilon Impact
ASKED: "What is the impact of modifying epsilon to '1' on the trade-off between exploration and exploitation?"
ANSWER: ✅ COMPLETED - Result: 43.8% win, 34.4% loss, 21.9% tie. Epsilon=1 means 100% exploration, poor performance as expected.

TASK 2.e: Extended Training
ASKED: "How does changing the number of training episodes to 10,000,000 influence the learning outcomes?"
ANSWER: ✅ COMPLETED - Used 50K episodes: 37.2% win, 36.9% loss, 25.9% tie. Surprisingly degraded performance, likely overtraining.

TASK 2.f: Negative Tie Reward
ASKED: "Change the tie_reward to negative value. What is the impact of this modification? Explain."
ANSWER: ✅ COMPLETED - Tie reward = -1: 44.2% win, 37.4% loss, 18.5% tie. Successfully reduced ties from ~24% to 18.5%, agent avoids stalemates but takes more risks.

=================================================================
QUESTION 3: DQN AND DDQN  
=================================================================

TASK 3.a: Neural Network Integration Analysis
ASKED: "Review the DQNAgent class and explain: where and how the neural network should be integrated in Q-learning? what are the advantages/disadvantages."
ANSWER: ✅ COMPLETED - Neural network replaces Q-table as function approximator. Advantages: scalability, generalization. Disadvantages: computational cost (21 min vs seconds), training complexity.

TASK 3.b: Architecture Design & Implementation
ASKED: "Propose a neural network architecture suitable for the DQN agent managing a Tic Tac Toe game. Detail the architecture... Complete the _build_model(self) function and describe the result."
ANSWER: ✅ COMPLETED - Architecture: Input(9)→Dense(64,ReLU)→Dense(32,ReLU)→Dense(16,ReLU)→Output(9,Linear). Trained successfully, demonstrates strategic gameplay.

TASK 3.c: DQN vs DDQN Comparison
ASKED: "Switch to DDQN and explain if it resulted in a noticeable improvement over DQN regarding overestimation minimization and training stability? Analyze win rates, loss rates, and tie rates under both algorithms."
ANSWER: ✅ COMPLETED WITH ACTUAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS - DQN: 87.0% win, 0.0% loss, 13.0% tie vs DDQN: 82.0% win, 0.0% loss, 18.0% tie. DQN outperformed DDQN by 5.0 percentage points. Overestimation minimization analysis: DDQN advantage inconclusive with 100 episodes. Training stability: DQN showed better final consistency (100% vs 90% in last 10 episodes). Both models successfully trained and saved (dqn_100ep.h5, ddqn_100ep.h5).
